1. Server Deployment and Setup Automation

- Provision a Linux server with the right operating system and the most important software packages (PHP, database server, web server, Node.js for frontend builds, etc.).

- Transfer the application files to the server and run the frontend build process.

- Use Composer to install all PHP dependencies.

- Configure the database by creating users, establishing permissions, and running migrations/seeders to create the required tables and default records.

- Configure the application's database connection via environment settings.

- Automate the entire setup and deployment process via GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines). That way, every approved and tested pull request triggers an automated build, test, and deploy process, reducing human effort and making it more reliable.

2. Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Utilize GitHub Actions workflows to deploy code updates automatically on the server whenever new commits are submitted, tested, and approved.

- Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and static code tools (e.g., PHPStan, Pest, PHPUnit) into the CI pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.

- Deploy updates with zero downtime (e.g., with Laravel Envoyer, GitHub Actions w/ rsync, or containerized solutions such as Docker + Kubernetes).

3. Database Optimization and Performance Improvements

- Ensure that foreign key columns and fields used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses are properly indexed to optimize queries.

- Use caching levels such as Redis to store results of frequently accessed queries, Laravel responses, or session data.

- Use eager loading for Eloquent ORM to avoid the N+1 query problem.

- Periodically examine query execution plans and if scaling is required, use database sharding, read replicas, or connection pooling.

4. Security and Infrastructure Hardening

- Use Let's Encrypt (or another trusted Certificate Authority) to automatically obtain and renew SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections.

- Ensure sensitive files such as .env are not versioned (.gitignore) to ensure application secrets and API keys remain secure.

- Install firewalls:

- On-premises servers use iptables or ufw.

- On cloud providers like AWS, use security groups or network ACLs.

- Optional addition of a third-party firewall or Web Application Firewall (WAF) (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS WAF, or server-level tools such as ModSecurity).

- Keep server packages current and have services and users implement least privilege access.

- Implement automated backups using the Spatie Laravel Backup package to regularly back up the application files, databases, and storage.

- Configure the package to store backups in a secure cloud provider (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or DigitalOcean Spaces).

- Enable encryption for all backups to ensure data security and compliance with best practices.

- Define a retention policy to automatically prune old backups while keeping recent and critical ones available.

- Regularly test the backup restoration process to guarantee that disaster recovery is quick and reliable in case of server failure, data corruption, or accidental deletion.

5. Application Monitoring and Observability

- Use Laravel Pulse to monitor performance metrics, slow queries, and real-time information on application behavior.

- Use Laravel Nightwatch (or Laravel Dusk for browser testing) to monitor important user flows and check whether frontend features are correct after deployments.

- Use application monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Laravel Telescope to debug and monitor performance in detail.

- Set up logging and alert pipelines (e.g., via Slack, Email, or Opsgenie) for reporting error and detecting anomalies.
